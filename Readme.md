## Instructions: 
In order to run test you can use IDE or you need to call `mvn clean test` task inside the project folder.
In order to get report you need to call `allure serve target/allure-results/` task inside the project folder. But to be able to do so
you need to install `allure` with `brew install allure` (Mac OS). 

## What could be improved: 
- Attach logs to allure report
- Increase test coverage
